# Project 3: Spots - An image sharing webpage with a responsive layout

An image sharing webpage.

## Description

This webpage allows users to name and upload images that can then be interacted with by other users. Users can create unique profiles that are able to be editted as well.

Using buttons with hover effects, you can see how future users would be able to like the images of the webpage's owner.

The webpage is made so elements are situably displayed on popular screen sizes with images and image titles collapsing smaller to prevent horizontal scrolling.
